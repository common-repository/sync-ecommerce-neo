Imports Products and data from NEO software to WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to import simple products from NEO to WooCommerce. 

It creates a new menu in WooCommerce > Products > Import products from NEO.

You can import simple products, and it will create new products if it does not find the SKU code from your WooCommerce. If the SKU exists, it will import all data except title and description from the product. The stock will be imported as well.

You will have to ask for the API Key to the company Bartolomé Consultores.

¡We have a Premium version!
These are the features:
- Import categories from NEO.
- Import attributes as brands or others.
- Import variable products.
- Automate the syncronization.
